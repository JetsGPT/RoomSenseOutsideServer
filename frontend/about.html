            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Residential buildings, schools, and homes frequently suffer from the absence of a system that delivers
                precise, real-time environmental and occupancy data.
                RoomSense equips users with actionable insights, enabling them to formulate their own automation or
                management strategies.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                By delivering precise and scalable data collection, we lay the groundwork for more informed
                decision-making in buildings.
            </p>
